# Smart Contract example.

## Things I've **learned**:

* To use an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and run some Contracts on a non production purpose Ethereum Blockchain on-line called [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

* If you want, you can access to `Remix's GitHub repository` [here](https://github.com/ethereum/remix) and clone it.

* When you use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), once you have runned your contract, you can trigger his functions by pushing buttons in down-right side of the GUI, Blue ones are for Getter functions, and Red ones are for Setter functions.

* By using "public" for a variable, is directly making a **getter function** on it.

* In a getter function, there is no need to mine a Block but, in a setter case, you have to mine a Block because you are changing the contract's Data.

* If you are stucked with `**No visibility specified explicitly for function**'s` error, you have to put `public` statement to all the functions in your contract, and you will solve the visibility issue.

### I'm traiyng to do something with the following tutorials:
